# python

Formatting String :

The new way in python 3.6 onwards : F-String

x = 10
formatted = f"I have told you {X} times already"

The tried and run way : .format method

x = 10
formatted = "I have told you {} times already".format(10)

The old Way : % operator (deprecated)

x = 10
formatted = "I have told you %d times already" % (x)
